## Overview
## ********
## The aim is to simulate an epidemic in a large population for 100 days, and try 
## to answer the following questions: what do the daily infection trajectories look like
## for the 10% of the population with the lowest individual transmission possibilities,
## and how do they compare to the infection trajectories for the whole population? To 
## address these questions, the number of new infections each day among the whole population,
## the 10% population with the lowest individual transmission possibilities and a radom
## sample of 0.1% of the population are recorded respectively. After that, a plot showing
## how the daily infections trajectories compare between the whole population and the two
## samples are produced. Finally, by running 10 replicate simulations, the variability in
## the results are visualized.
##
## Algorithm details
## *****************
## 1. The initial susceptible population of size 5.5 million is set, and 10 randomly chosen people 
##    are set to the exposed (E) state.
## 2. Once exposed, people have a daily daily probability 1/3 entering the infectious (I) state.
## 3. Each day an uninfected person, j, has a probability lambda*beta[j]*the sum of betas of all
##    currently of infectious people of being infected,and entering the E state, where lambda is
##    an overall viral infectivity parameter, vector beta contains relative contact rates for all
##    people, and the average value of betap[i] over the whole population is 1.
## 4. The infectious have a daily probability of 1/5 of leaving the infectious state (recovery or 
##    transition to serious disease). Over the course of simulation re-infection is not considered.
## 5. 9 vectors are created to record the number of people in the exposed (E), infectious (I) and 
##    recovered (R) states for the whole population, the 'cautious 10%' and the 0.1% of random sample
##    each day.
## 6. The new infections on day i (i>1) for three populations are then caculated by summing the differences
##    between E state and I state, and then plus the increase of number of individuals in R state.
## 7.
